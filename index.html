        When it comes to online shopping, accurate product information is crucial to ensure a seamless customer
        experience. However, providing high-quality product data can be challenging, especially in the fashion
        industry,
        where training image classification models requires large amounts of annotated data.

            <strong>Synthetic data generation</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            We generate synthetic fashion images using computer-graphics techniques. The generated images do not
            require
            manual human validation.
            For each render we start with a provided 3D object, add lighting effects, apply a
            procedural
            material and then randomize its properties (e.g. colors, scale). This setup allows an arbitrary
            amount
            of
            different images for each 3D object to be generated programmatically.

            <strong> Approach</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Unsupervised domain adaptation has shown excellent results when translating images to other domains.
            Nevertheless, translated images can’t be readily
            used to train classification models because image features, such as patterns, are
            distorted during the translation step since the translation model doesn’t have
            information about the features. Specifically, when complex patterns are shifted
            to a different domain, they can be distorted to a level that they no longer adhere to the original
            pattern label
            for the synthetic image. For example, stripes may no longer look 'stripey' when shifted to the new domain.

        <div class="text-image">
            The proposed architecture includes an image translation model and a classifier model, which are
            optimized
            together via a common loss that ensures realistic images with reliable annotations. Pseudo-labeled
            real images
            are included in each mini-batch to improve the classifier generalization.

        <strong> Results</strong>

        <br>
        We compare the performance of domain adaptation algorithms trained only on our 31,840 synthetically
        generated
        dataset and evaluated on real fashion images. Our approach outperforms the other algorithms for
        the
        pattern classification task. Finally, we found that using pseudo-labels improves the results with minor
        changes
        in the training.

        <strong>Conclusions</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Combining synthetic data generation with unsupervised domain adaptation can successfully classify patterns in
        clothes without real-world annotations. We also found that attaching a classifier to an image translation model
        can enforce label stability, thus improving performance. Furthermore, our experiments confirm that Fashion CUT
        outperforms other domain adaptation algorithms in the fashion domain. In addition, pseudo-labels proved to be
        beneficial for domain adaptation in the advanced stages of the training.
